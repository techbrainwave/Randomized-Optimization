## 02 - Randomized Optimization


### **What is an Optimization Problem?**

An optimization problem is defined by Russell and Norvig (2010) as a problem in which “the aim is to find the best state according to an objective function.”

### **Algorithms**
1. Hill climbing
2. Randomized hill-climbing 
3. Simulated annealing
4. Genetic algorithms
5. Neural Network

### **Optimization Problems**
1. Knapsack
2. Travelling Salesperson
3. N-Queens
4. Max-K Color optimization
5. Flip Flop
6. Continuous Peaks
